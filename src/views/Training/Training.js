            Being in the permanent cosmetics business for 28+ years, Pam has seen the repercussion of inadequate training within the field.  As scalp micropigmentation began to grow and enter the US market, she saw the same pattern forming again regarding training.

            The program that Trillium Ink Scalp Academy has built is a hybrid training program that requires online study and practice drills that allow students the time necessary to refine their skills before proceeding to the hands-on portion of the training. There is no room for error, so students must pass assessments on the first day of class before working on live models.

            The online portion of the training contains the fundamental building blocks to give students solid knowledge in every area of scalp micropigmentation.  Though we do not disclose our curriculum online, you are welcome to call any of our instructors and discuss this at length.

            Students learn basic application skills through video instruction, then practice drills and send their work to us via pics/text/email.  We guide them and perfect their skills through systematic practice drills until they have demonstrated a sufficient level of ability, at which time they advance to the next level of drills.  There are study modules to be completed and quizzes to measure progress.  80% competency is required to pass the quizzes. Students also do some outside study and papers are required in the areas listed.

            At the hands-on class, students work closely with instructors at a ratio of not more than 4 students to 1 instructor.  Forty hours of hands-on time makes this an intense course.  We provide an average of 6 live models per class.  We want students to be exposed to as many real-life cases, skin types, hair types, balding patterns and special situations as possible so that they are confident when starting to do procedures on their own.
